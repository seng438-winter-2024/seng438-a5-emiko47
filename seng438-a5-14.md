# Introduction
In this lab, our main focus was on  analysis of integration test data using reliability assessment tools.

the main 2 focuses were -
* Reliability growth testing
* Reliability assessment using Reliability Demonstration Chart=(RDC)

for Reliability growth testing the testing tool used was SRTAT

for Reliability assessment using Reliability Demonstration Chart we also used SRTAT.
# 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 
When using SRTAT, the only models that worked and did not give an error were

* Geometric
* Littlewood and Varral's Bayesian Reliability

To start, we had to convert out failure data into a 'Failure count' or 'Time between failures' format.

Once the data provided was converted and imported, we found the following results - 

* ## For Geometric -

# kolmogorov Distance
* for geometric, we can see that = 0.21704806902832408 
* for Littlewood and Varral's Bayesian Reliability = 0.22823349454015562

* a lower Kolmogorov distance is considered better, as it suggests a smaller difference or distance between the compared distribution, so the model chosen would be geometric. we know the geometric distribution offers simplicity but is limited in its applicability, Littlewood and Varral's Bayesian Reliability model offers flexibility and robustness, but is resource intensive, thus geometric is the best choice based on its kolmogorov Distance and advantages

# Comparison of Results


# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques
1. Similarities:
* they both focus on assessing and improving product/system reliability.
* They involve statistical analysis for decision-making.

2. Differences:
Growth Testing: Identifies and solves reliability issues when developing.
RDC: helps in showing product reliability before release.

Growth Testing: Conducted during development.
RDC: usually done at the end of development.

Growth Testing: large scope, it basically coverers all development stages.
RDC: very specific focus on reliability andreadiness for release.
