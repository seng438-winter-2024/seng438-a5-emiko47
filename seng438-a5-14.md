# Introduction
In this lab, our main focus was on  analysis of integration test data using reliability assessment tools.

the main 2 focuses were -
* Reliability growth testing
* Reliability assessment using Reliability Demonstration Chart=(RDC)

for Reliability growth testing the testing tool used was SRTAT

for we also used SRTAT.
# 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 
When using SRTAT, the only models that worked and did not give an error were

* Geometric
* Littlewood and Varral's Bayesian Reliability

To start, we had to convert out failure data into a 'Failure count' or 'Time between failures' format.

Once the data provided was converted and imported, we found the following results - 



# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 
Data used - converted version of DATA2.dat from Failure Data provided.
